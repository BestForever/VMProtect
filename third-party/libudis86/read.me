This is slightly modified libudis86 1.7 (from http://udis86.sourceforge.net/)
I changed declaration of all tables to be const
Also ssse3 & sse4 was added

You can build it
1) under windows - with Visual Studion 2008 via libudis86.vcproj
2) as static library for drivers - with WDK via Makefile & Sources
3) as static Linux library with gcc - via Makefile.lnx
